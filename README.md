This is initially just my portfolio website 

## Reason 
    * I am creating this because I want to showcase what I can build.

    * Also since I am fucking bored of things now I don't wanna participate in this rat race to get the job
    From now I will just focus on my work and create the stuff which i want to create

## Favorite
This will contain all my ** projects ** with the source code and screenshots and live hosted
either on Heroku,netlify or github pages or firebase.


### Things I will create

        * about me
        * projects
    * footer 
       * contact us
