This is initially just my portfolio website 

## Reason 
    * I am creating this because I want to showcase what I can build.

    * Also since I am fucking bored of things now I don't wanna participate in this rat race to get the job
    From now I will just focus on my work and create the stuff which i want to create

## Favorite
This will contain all my ** projects ** with the source code and screenshots and live hosted
either on Heroku,netlify or github pages or firebase.


### Things I will create
    * header
        * logo 
        * Home About Contac
    * main body
        * about me
        * projects
    * footer 
       * contact us 

#### My Learnings:-

    *  **inline Tag** these tag does not cause a line break 
        * Examples:- anchor tag,img tag 
    *  **Block Level** these tag basically cause a line break and it take a complete line in the HTML file
        * heading (h1,h2...),div
    * main parts:- other than the above difference everything is same

    * overflow:hidden it will hide the content outside the box other options 
    overflow: scroll whatever the content is it will be scrollable
